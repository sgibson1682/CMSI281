======================

Nice job on this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your code looks great and thanks for doing headers!

These were from Sam's repo.

The inOrderTraversal does work, but as always, you can do more
testing.  For example, after doing the traversal once, remove
a node or two and do it again, to make sure the bubbling works.
Just a suggestion -- there's NEVER enough testing, really...

Actually, that goes across the board for all your applications in
this set...  Pay attention to good testing methods, it's part of
the CRAFT of writing good programs and in the modern software
engineering environment you will HAVE to do this kind of stuff!
You may as well get used to it now and make it part of your own
operational programming philosophy!

I notice you removed the menu system, I won't fault you for that,
but it was unexpected....  still giving you credit for it.
