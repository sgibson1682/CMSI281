Homework03 Evaluation
======================

Nice work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Good job on the sorting.  Try to think of more tests that you
can do.  Good job on letting the user know which test is which,
and it's also helpful to have an idea of what the expected output
will be so the user has something to compare with for checking if
the program works correctly.  Don't neglect negative numbers, and
things like lists that are pre-sorted or pre-sorted in reversed
order.

The Simon game works but I couldn't figure out specifically how
to enter the letters in sequence.  With two letters, if I enter
them together like "br" it tells me that's not a color.  If I
enter them one at a time and press enter between, it tells me I
lost.  It DOES ask if I want to play again, though...

EXCELLENT use of JavaDocs, thank you!!  You don't need to put in
an @author tag for every method, unless you are flagging that one
of you wrote one thing and the other wrote another.  It's actually
a collaboration, so both names at the top of the file is perfect.

Total credit is 13 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 20 points for all three

you got 13 out of 13 which is 100% which is an A-plus
